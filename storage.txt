inside test there will be a property version
We will save all tests here
test10={}
test11={}
..

testStatistic10

testVersions = {}
we can have one separate key value that will contain all test version

test10results={1:2,2:1}
test11results= question selected answer

We will have to think about friend and similar

User info will probably be saved
